# Nitrous
## Adds nitrous oxide bottles to TLD

### Features:
- 5 sizes of nitrous bottles, replacing the soda siphon
- Boost gauge, replacing palack01, the silver tank with the red stripe
- Size is put on the bottom of the bottle. 1 is smallest, 5 is biggest
- Like the turbo mod you can mount the bottle, except you can mount it anywhere on, or anything attached to the car
- Nitrous key is R by default but can be configured in the mod settings
- It increases engine power, boosts the RPMs a little bit for some more initial oomph
- While active it also increases fuel consumption and temperature
- Bottles drain at a constant rate, with drain being evenly distributed across any mounted bottles
- Bottle size only affects capacity, not boost amount. A size 1 bottle will provide the same boost as a size 5, just for less overall time
- Each mounted bottle adds more boost, but it's not just a x2 for each bottle, you'll hit a point of diminishing returns after a certain number (idk what) to keep it balanced
- Blue smoke is emitted from the car when nitrous is active
- Gas hiss noise when nitrous is active
- Look at a tank to show how much is left
